# bf2cc (Brute force attack on Caesar Cipher Algorithm)
brute force attack on caesar cipher

Repo contains 4 files
  1) encryption.py
  2) source.py
  3) ciphertext.txt
  4) brute.txt

first, User enters plain text with key by running encryption.py file that stores the cipher text in ciphertext.txt file
then, source.py file takes the ciphertext from that file and apply brute force attack on it
finally, all possible output text will written to brute.txt file, we can find mose readble text in it

in future, we can set the ability to our code to identify the most readable texts from that file.
